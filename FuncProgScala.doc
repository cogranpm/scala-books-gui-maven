what is a side effect
modify variable
modifying a data structure in place
setting field on an object
throw exception or halt with an error
print to console or read user input
reading from or writing to a file
drawing on the screen

class Cafe {
	def buyCoffee (cc: CreditCard) : Coffee = {
		val cup = new Coffee()
		cc.charge(cup.price)
		cup
		}
}

adding a payments object

def buyCoffee (cc: CreditCard, p: Payments) : Coffee = {
	val cup = new Coffee()
	p.charge(cc, cup.price)
	cup
	}
}

payments can be an interface
can be mocked
basically sending a payment is a side effect

return a charge object instead as a value
all the side effects therefore are handled elsewhere

def buyCoffee(cc: CreditCard) : (Coffee, Charge) = {
	val cup = new Coffee()
	(cup, Charge(cc, cup.price))
	}
}
